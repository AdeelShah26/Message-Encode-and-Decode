# Message-Encode-and-Decode
This program uses the principle used in cryptography, for encoding and decoding a message.
I have made a message Encode and decode project in python, that allows us to enter a message containing string values, 
String is then converted into a matrix of elements, where each element corresponds to its order in alphabets. In this step the encoding is completed.
After encoding we can also decode the message by taking the encoded message reversing the process again. In this step the decoding is completed.
Finally we can get our original message on the console.
